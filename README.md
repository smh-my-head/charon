# SolidWorks Git Tools
Provides integration with git diff and git merge for SolidWorks parts and
assemblies. Add this repo as a submodule and then run
`./sldworks-git-tools/setup_gitconfig.sh` from git bash.

This repository is currently missing the necessary SolidWorks macros `compareasm.swp`
and `compareprt.swp`.
