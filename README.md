# SolidWorks Git Tools
Provides integration with git diff and git merge for SolidWorks parts and
assemblies. Add this repo as a submodule and then run
`./sldworks-git-tools/setup_gitconfig.sh` from git bash.

It's all functional now but requires the user to navigate a few SolidWorks
menus on their own. An improvement would be to use SolidWorks VBA macros to
streamline this.

There are a lot of possible edge cases so it's possible I've missed one of
them. Please open an issue if anything isn't working as expected.
