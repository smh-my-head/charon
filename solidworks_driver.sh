Usage: $0 [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2
Opens a comparison between the two files in SolidWorks.

  -h, --help            display this help and exit
  -c, --check-health    check if a virtual machine is accessible

If you are using a VM, this will make some assumptions
(which are the defaults of solidworks-vm)

1. if you are using qemu and require the vm to access the host, there is a
   network drive at //10.0.2.4/qemu which mounts $HOME
2. If you require ssh access to the guest, MSYS2 is accessible at
   archuser@localhost:6969
3. The password of the guest is 'a'. (This should not be a security issue, as
   no ports on the guest should be exposed)
